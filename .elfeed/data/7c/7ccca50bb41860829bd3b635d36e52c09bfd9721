<p>We&#39;ve known this for some time over here in the
<a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> corner of the
world - all of our collections are immutable and modeled directly on
the original Clojure versions written in Java. Modern JavaScript
engines have now been tuned to the point that it&#39;s no longer uncommon
to see collection performance within 2.5X of the Java Virtual Machine.</p>

<p>Wait, wait, wait. What does the performance of persistent data structures have
to do with the future of JavaScript MVCs?</p>

<p>A whole lot.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how, perhaps unintuitively, immutable data allows a new
library, <a href="http://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>, to outperform a
reasonably performant JavaScript
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> like
<a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> without hand optimization from
the user. Om itself is built upon the absolutely wonderful
<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> library from Facebook. If
you haven&#39;t checked it out before, I
recommend <a href="http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/pete-hunt-react-rethinking-best-practices.html">watching this video from JSConf EU 2013</a>.
Interestingly because of immutable data Om can deliver even better results
than using React out of the box.</p>

<p>These benchmarks are not designed to prove that Om is the fastest
UI component system in the world. These benchmarks are
designed to demonstrate that it&#39;s important to avoid implementation
decisions that defy global optimization or leave so little guidance
that users will inevitably make these same problematic design
decisions themselves.</p>

<p>Of course you can correct these issues in your client side application
on a
<a href="http://blog.scalyr.com/2013/10/31/angularjs-1200ms-to-35ms/">tedious case by case basis</a>,
but the whole point of Om is to deliver competitive levels of
component abstraction while making an entire family of common and
tedious hand optimization techniques <em>obsolete</em>.</p>

<h2>Game of Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Open the <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/todomvc/labs/architecture-examples/om/index.html">Om TodoMVC in a tab</a> and run the first benchmark. It
creates 200 todos and on my 11 inch Macbook Air it takes Safari 7 around
120ms to render.</p>

<p>Now open up the <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/todomvc/architecture-examples/backbone/index.html">Backbone.js TodoMVC in a tab</a> and run the same
 benchmark.  On my machine this takes around 500ms to render.</p>

<p>Under Chrome and Firefox, Om on my machine is consistently 2-4X
faster. If you try toggling all of the todos you&#39;ll notice
Om feels natural, while Backbone.js will feel a bit janky. This is
probably because Om always re-renders on
<a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/">requestAnimationFrame</a>. A
pretty nice optimization to have enabled in your applications.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the Chrome Dev Tools JS profile flame graphs for this benchmark
is suprisingly informative as far as how React/Om works out of the box
versus how unoptimized Backbone.js works:</p>

<p>This is React/Om:</p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc" src="/assets/images/om.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is Backbone.js:</p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc" src="/assets/images/bb.jpg" /></p>

<p>The React/Om flame graph seems to suggest, at least to my eyes, a
design far more amenable to global optimization.</p>

<p>Ok, excellent work! But, uh, while 2-4X faster across 3 major browsers
should be enough to get anyone interested, especially considering the
fact that we&#39;re achieving this level of performance <em>because of</em> immutable
data, that&#39;s nowhere near the 30X-40X claims you might have
seen me make on Twitter.</p>

<p>Try the second Om benchmark - it creates 200 todos, toggles them all 5
times, and then deletes them. Safari 7 on my 11 inch Macbook Air takes around
5ms to render this.</p>

<p>Make sure to delete all of the todos from the Backbone.js benchmark
first, then try the second Backbone.js benchmark. On my machine, running Safari,
this takes around 4200ms to complete.</p>

<p><em>How is this possible?</em></p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Om never does any work it doesn&#39;t have to. Data, views and control
logic are not tied together. If data changes, we never immediately
trigger a re-render - we simply schedule a render of the data via
<code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. Om conceptually considers the browser as
something more akin to a GPU.</p>

<p>I suspect many JS MVC applications follow the Backbone.js TodoMVC lead
and link together changes in the model, the view, and truly orthogonal
concerns like serializing app state into <code>localStorage</code> simply out of
convenience, as few frameworks provide the required support to ensure that users
keep these concerns architecturally separate. But really this should come as
no surprise, because the predominant culture leans on string based templates,
CSS selectors, and direct DOM manipulation - all markers of <em>place-oriented</em>
programming, and all potential bottlenecks which Om leaves behind.</p>

<p>Of course you can use Backbone.js or your favorite JS MVC with React,
and that&#39;s a <a href="http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/">great combo</a>
that delivers
<a href="http://github.com/usepropeller/react.backbone">a lot of value</a>. However,
I&#39;ll go out on a limb and say I simply don&#39;t believe in event-oriented
MVC systems - the flame graph above says it all. Decoupling the
models from the views is only the first important step.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this gives fans of the current crop of JS MVCs, and even people
who believe in just using plain JavaScript and jQuery, some food for
thought. I&#39;ve shown that a compile-to-JavaScript language which uses
slower data structures ends up faster than a reasonably fast
competitor for rich user interfaces. To top it off,
<a href="http://github.com/swannodette/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/labs/architecture-examples/om/src/todomvc/app.cljs">Om TodoMVC</a>,
with the same bells and whistles as everyone else, weighs in at ~260 lines
of code (including all the templates) and the minified code is 63K
gzipped (this total includes the 27K of React, the entire
ClojureScript standard libary, core.async, a routing library, and
several helpers from Google Closure).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a JavaScript developer, I think taking a hard look at React
is a really good idea. I think in the future, coupling React with a
persistent data structure library like
<a href="http://swannodette.github.io/mori/">mori</a> could bring JS applications
all the way to the type of flexible yet highly-tuned architecture that
Om delivers. While it&#39;s true immutable data structures tend to
generate more garbage, we strongly believe modern JS engines are up to
the task and the hardware we carry around in our pockets is improving
at a rapid clip.</p>

<p>Technical description follows.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Modifying and querying the DOM is a huge performance bottleneck, and
React embraces an approach that eschews this without sacrificing
expressivity. It presents a well-designed object-oriented interface,
but everything underneath the hood has been crafted with the eye of a
pragmatic functional programmer. It works by generating a virtual
version of the DOM and, as your application state evolves, it diffs changes
between the virtual DOM trees over time. It uses these diffs to make
the minimal set of changes required on the real DOM so you don&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>When React does a diff on the virtual DOM specified by your components,
there is a very critical function - <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>. If this
returns false, React will never compute the children of the
component. That is, <em>React builds the virtual DOM tree lazily for
diffing based on what path in the tree actually changed</em>.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the default <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> implementation is
extremely conservative, because JavaScript devs tend to mutate
objects and arrays! So in order to determine if some properties of a component
have changed, they have to manually walk JavaScript objects and arrays
to figure this out.</p>

<p>Instead of using JavaScript objects, Om uses ClojureScript data
structures which we know will not be changed. Because of this, we can
provide a component that implements <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> by doing
the fastest check possible - a reference equality check. This means we
can always determine if the paths changed, starting from the root, in
logarithmic time.</p>

<p>Thus we don&#39;t need React operations like <code>setState</code>, which
exists to support both efficient subtree updating as well as good
object-oriented style. Subtree updating for Om
starting from root is always lightning fast because we&#39;re just doing
reference equality checks all the way down.</p>

<p>Also, because we always re-render from the root, batched updates are
trivial to implement. We don&#39;t bother with the batched update support
in React, as it&#39;s designed to handle cases we don&#39;t care about, so we
can just use our own 6-line rocket fuel enhancement.</p>

<p>Finally, because we always have the entire state of the UI in a single
piece of data, we can trivially serialize all of the important app
state - we don&#39;t need to bother with serialization protocols, or
making sure that everyone implements them correctly. Om UI states are
always serializable, always snapshottable.</p>

<p>This also means that Om UIs get undo for free. You can simply
snapshot any state in memory and reinstate it whenever you like. It&#39;s
memory-efficient, as ClojureScript data structures work by sharing
structure.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>In short, I don&#39;t think there is much of a future in the current crop
of JavaScript MVCs. I think if you sit down and think for months and
years, in the end only something akin to React/Om (even if tucked away under
a traditional MVC hood) will deliver an optimal balance between
simplicity, performance, and expressivity. There&#39;s
nothing special here that hasn&#39;t been known for a long, long
time. If you treat the browser as a remote rendering engine and stop
treating it as a place to query and store crap, everything gets
faster. Sound like something familiar? Yeah, computer graphics
programming.</p>

<p>Expect more posts in the future elaborating ideas I&#39;ve only hinted at
or haven&#39;t mentioned: VCR playback of UI state, trivial UI
instrumentation, client/server template sharing, relational user
interfaces, and much more.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>I would not have written this post or written Om if wasn&#39;t for the
following people.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonbloom">Brandon Bloom</a> has been bugging me
for many months to give React a closer look. Sadly I didn&#39;t give it a
proper chance until I saw
<a href="http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/pete-hunt-react-rethinking-best-practices.html">Peter Hunt&#39;s JSConf EU 2013 presentation</a>,
which explained the architecture.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/kovasb">Kovas Boguta</a> for humoring and
encouraging me through several Om design discussions.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a> for
inadvertently giving me the original inspiration to try something like
Om via a Twitter conversation and to
<a href="http://twitter.com/floydophone">Peter Hunt</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/spicyj">Ben Alpert</a> and the other super friendly
people on the React IRC channel for answering my numerous
questions. Without the great technology that is React none of the above
would have been possible.</p>
